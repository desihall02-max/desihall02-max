My name is Desirae Hall, a recent business data analyst graduate with experience of 6 technical projects. In May 2025, I enrolled in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program. The curriculum covered business analytics, SQL, Tableau data visualization and storytelling, Power BI and Python. These technical skills have built upon my tenure in business, retail, sales and finance. It also involved numerous practical projects. Now, I am eager to leverage my data and visualization skills in the fashion, beauty or marketing sector to drive growth and boost sales.

Currently, I am in line for an externship with TripleTen, in this stage of the program, I will have the opportunity to apply my skills to real life projects. My previous experience in business, retail and marketing and years of customer service with finance clients have helped me develop my communication, analytical, time- management, and problem-solving skills.
You can learn more about this and my other projects in my repositories!
